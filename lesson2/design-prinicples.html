                        I chose this website because I find it to be one of the easier news websites to navigate. 
                        Many other websites can feel cluttered and have a lot of different types of elements on a page. 
                        CNN is a good example of there being no uniform news article format. 
                        However, the Associated Press features a top article (not pictured) with the pattern above, which is repeated for all further articles. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This makes it easy to look through the articles and even when they are grouped in different sections, it is easy to recognize them for what they are. .

                    <p>
                        Whenever I think of a design that uses whitespace, Apple is always at the forefront. 
                        I do not personally own any Apple products, but their designs always seem to focus on a central idea and double down on it. 
                        They donâ€™t want to tell you everything about what they sell. They are selective about the features they promote and their designs 
                        all work to emphasize that message. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It also brings a sense of luxury, because they have a limited amount of space before our attention is lost and they use it to emphasize a single, 
                        or fewer points.

                        I do not often use Twitter but I know that it is likely most used on mobile, so I wanted to see how they set up their website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What stuck out to me was how much they able to tie it together with the use of the space. 
                        It all flows because everything was designed with intent. 
                        The use of the space for the cover photo, profile picture and follow button all relate to each other and, although the sizes are all different, 
                        they share certain spaces. For instance, the follow button is centered in the space between the cover photo and the bottom of the profile picture. 
                        While the cover photo is full-width, the profile picture and the follow button share the padding of the section below, 
                        allowing the profile picture and follow button to ease the transition into the bio.
