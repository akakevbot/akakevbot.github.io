        Personas: 
      </h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          <strong>Jason:</strong> Jason is a young single adult male who is dedicated to his work. He lives in a busy, metropolitan area and, while he has a car, 
          relies on public transit or walking to get around. Outside of the regular work hours, his phone is also connected to his work email as well as his work chat. 
          As a result, his attention on his phone is split between work and personal. 
          He also enjoys visiting his family during the dates on the weekends and going out with friends later at night. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Taylor:</strong> Taylor is a mother of 5 kids, 4 boys and a girl (the youngest). She stays at home with the kids and is constantly running to and from various practices, like choir, debate, and soccer. 
          She is an avid runner who likes to train early in the morning so she can still have time to run errands while the kids are in school. 
          She spends little time on her phone idly, mostly using it to communicate with her kids, other family members, and close friends, but she will browse social media occasionally to help herself unwind.

      <h3>5 scenarios</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Jason is getting ready to leave for work. 
          He quickly visits Weather Me Not in order to confirm if the clothes he is wearing are appropriate for the day, and to see if he should walk or take the bus. 
          It is springtime and he has gotten into a habit of wearing shorts but is concerned today might be too cold. 
          Seeing today is considered an average day, he heads out the door. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Taylor is winding down in the evening and remembers that she isn’t sure of the weather for her run in the morning. 
          It is summer and while that is mostly dry where she lives, she heard it was supposed to rain, which she has never particularly enjoyed running in. 
          She visits Weather Me Not to quickly confirm. She sees that temperatures are where they usually are but that it will rain lightly. 
          As a result, she decides to still run, albeit with a light jacket 
        </li>
        <li>
          Jason is planning a week-long trip to visit his parents out of the city. His family is rather big and the house can feel crowded at times. 
          In the evenings, he will usually sit on the family porch with his brothers and talk. 
          It is early fall and he has packed some light outerwear but wants to make sure he has packed appropriate clothes for these evening conversations. 
          He checks Weather me not in order to quickly see if there are any unexpected trends during his trip. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Taylor is planning a family picnic for one of her children’s spring birthdays. 
          She wants to celebrate it on the weekend and she would like it to be sunny, but most spring days where they live are often wet. 
          She visits Weather Me Not in order to quickly see when the next Sunny Saturday would be. 
          Since the day is not an average day for this time of year, they easily stick out, letting her select the perfect day. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Jason is looking to practice his photography. He enjoys going to a local park after work as the sun setting as he likes the lighting. 
          However, summertime in the city he lives in is usually very sunny and he prefers the lighting when it is cloudy. 
          He looks at Weather Me Not in order to determine if there is a day this week that will meet his needs.
